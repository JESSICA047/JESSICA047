# 👋 Hey, I'm Jessica — Data Scientist in the Making
  
Started as a Biochemistry & Molecular Biology student, now I'm building my way into **data science, AI, and tech for social impact**. I believe the best insights come from asking better questions.

## 🌱 Philosophy & Drive

> *"Data without context is just noise. Context without action is just conversation."*

I'm driven by the intersection of **scientific rigor** and **social impact**. My biochemistry background taught me how to ask precise questions; data science is teaching me how to find scalable answers.

**What motivates me:**
- 🎯 Using data to solve real-world problems in underserved communities
- 🧠 Bridging the gap between domain expertise and technical implementation  
- 🌍 Building technology that amplifies human potential, especially in Africa
- 📖 Learning in public and sharing knowledge along the way

## 📫 Let's Connect
I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that combine **data, impact, and innovation**. Whether you're working on social good initiatives, need a fresh perspective on data problems, or just want to chat about the intersection of science and tech — let's build something meaningful together.

**Currently open to:** Data science internships, research collaborations, and mentorship opportunities
